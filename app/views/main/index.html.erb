        <p>A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and hence captures most or all
          of its power output. Freeman Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the long-term
          survival and escalating energy needs of a technological civilization, and
          proposed that searching for evidence of the existence of such structures might lead to the detection of advanced
          intelligent extraterrestrial life.
